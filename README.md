Download the project in any directory you want.

Open the project in your choice of IDE (I used Intellij)

Run MVN clean install and find the jar in the target folder.
Run that Jar with java -jar target/todoItems-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.
CD to src\main\ui in your terminal.

Run NPM Install and then run NPM Start.

You should be directed to localhost:4200 where you will see the now deployed app.
